/ EST - script pulls server time. Check it, most likely it will be pacific time - you
/ can adjust time in (today.getHours()+3) here - (PST+3) for EST
/ Script grabs day/hour bid data from spreadsheet, matches against server time and updates 
/ geolocation multipliers in all campaigns listed in column C. 
/ Day/time format is following: day 1-7 Sunday-Saturday, hour 0-23,  
/ for example 617 for Friday 5 pm.
/ Don’t miss comments in column headers on example spreadsheet: goo.gl/0Gh4VE 
/ Suggested use: schedule script to run every hour,
/ once it runs first time check time when it was running during the hour for example 8:55 all 
/  consequent runs are likely to be around this time too - 9:55, 10:55 etc. Adjust your 
/ bid-multipliers  on source spreadsheet accordingly.
